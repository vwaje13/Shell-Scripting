#Description: takes the name of a directory as an argument and searches the
# file hierarchy rooted at that directory for zero-length files. Writes
# the names of all zero-length files to standard output. 
#If there is no option on the command line, have the script delete
# the file after displaying its name, asking
# the user for confirmation, and receiving positive confirmation.
